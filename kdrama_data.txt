https://mydramalist.com/12130-unkind-women=Unkind Women=The drama is about four women spanning three generations in one household, who share the same hot-blooded temperament.  Thirty years ago, when her husband passed away in an accident, Kang Sunok raised her teenage daughters alone. She became famous for her cooking classes with the help of a talented young disciple named Park Eunsil. The oldest daughter, Hyeonjeong, eventually became a well-known news presenter. She has worked hard and never married, but as the story starts, changes are about to come as her boss favours younger women. Sunoks second daughter, Hyunsuk, cared more about pop music than about schoolwork, and stirred up intense dislike within her teacher. She got expelled from school due to a series of events, got married and had a daughter, Jeong Mari, at a young age. She made her child’s success her life’s priority and Mari studied hard to get her PhD in Korean literature before the age of 30.  As the drama starts, Hyunsuk is desperate to make more money to help her family, but things don’t go well. She happens to befriend a wealthy woman, Jang Moran, who becomes deeply involved with the family. Moran is elegant and rich, but she has kept a secret for 30 years – but can, or should, secrets be kept forever?   Jang Moran isn’t the only woman to enter the struggling family’s life. Na Hyeonae, winner of the Teacher of the Year award and a doting mother, and none other than the person who ruined Hyunsuk’s life, shows up. Hyunsuk makes a promise to herself to force an apology out of this woman – a mission that turns out not to be so easy.   In the meantime, Hyunsuk’s estranged husband does his best to quietly help, while three men with the same family name, Lee, also become important parts of the women’s lives.=Kim In Young=Han Sang Woo, Yoo Hyun Ki=Comedy, Romance, Drama=Sismance, Student Female Lead, Instructor Supporting Character, Female Centered Plot, Announcer Supporting Character, Announcer Female Lead, Married Supporting Character, Married Female Lead, Postgraduate Student Female Lead, News Presenter Female Lead, (Vote tags)=Kim Hye Ja, Chae Shi Ra, Do Ji Won, Lee Ha Na=24=Feb 25, 2015 - May 14, 2015=Wednesday, Thursday=KBS2=1 hr. 10 min.=Not Yet Rated=7.4 (scored by 779 users)=#7198=#5497=2,629=KBS World============

https://mydramalist.com/3777-standby=Standby=Standby is a workplace comedy that takes place at a fictional broadcast station, where our series lead Ryu Jin finds himself stuck in a career slump (can it be a slump if it never took off?) amidst dreams of anchoring the nightly news. Other characters include variety PDs, writers, and announcers who make up the broadcast station family.  Jung plays a young woman named So-min who grew up in a remote mountain village. She finds herself working a number of odd jobs once she makes the big move to Seoul, determined to make her way in the world and work hard at a successful career. So-min (the character) is a little behind the fashions and tends to say weird things that puzzle people, but she’s got a warm heart and a generous personality. Sadly, though, it’s that trusting nature that also makes her a target for opportunists.  - Dramabeans=Baek Sun Woo, Lee Eun Young, Hong Bo Hee==Business, Comedy, Sitcom=(Vote tags)=Ryu Jin, Lee Ki Woo, Ha Seok Jin, Claudia Kim, Jung So Min, Yim Si Wan=113=Apr 9, 2012 - Oct 5, 2012=Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday=MBC=23 min.=Not Yet Rated=7.2 (scored by 161 users)=#45871=#8403=1,304=============

Her life becomes difficult after her father, a once-popular singer, meets with an accident that was planned by his wife. Dan Bi then finds out that she was adopted. Her stepmother takes advantage of her husband's comatose state to kick Dan Bi out of their house, all in a plot to sell his land to the ruthless chairman of a hospital company.  This revelation leads Dan Bi to begin searching for her birth mother by using her adoptive father's will as leverage, not knowing that the truth about what happened to her birth father is directly tied to the chairman. She encounters several people along the way: the chairman's grandson who falls for Dan Bi but is uncertain of the outcome if they became a couple; a divorced lawyer whom Dan Bi loves, but whose father is also connected to her birth father, which is the reason why the lawyer's mother disapproves of Dan Bi for her son; the lawyer's ex-wife, and their daughter who likes Dan Bi more than her own mother; a step-sister who sees Dan Bi as a roadblock to climbing the corporate ladder; and an ailing doctor who was not only the love of Dan Bi's adoptive father's life, but knows the real truth about Dan Bi's parentage.
